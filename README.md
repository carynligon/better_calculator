This assignment was to make a fully functioning calculator. You can do single equations with multi-digit numbers and using the negative sign (the sign does not work if you click it first, you need to click a number and then make it negative, which is not ideal). This project was difficult for me. This was day 9 of the cohort and we had just started learning JavaScript. I'd eventually like to go back and make this into a fully fully functioning calculator.
